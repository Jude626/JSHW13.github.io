## Issues
- This was a very, very difficult assignment.. Following the README.md guidelines, I was able to create all the folders / routes, & completed most of the requirements asked. Unfortunately, I have bugs in my code that I was unable to fix before the due date time, hence this "broken car" submission. However, I still wanted to submit what I had as I'd coded way too much to not send it for some credit hopefully! Some things that I had the most trouble with are: (1) connecting the orm.js to the server, (2) full/proper completion of CRUD, & (3) deploying the app on heroku. Lastly I also didn't reach the point where I thought I should do CSS, so I left it at the back bone skeleton HTML handlebars only. The reason why is because I wanted to completed the main functionality / back end first, as it seems to be the priority of the assignment. I did my best & this is all I can submit, for now!!
